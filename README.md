# Inktomy
my favorite Rheas crater
Rhea (/ˈriə/ REE-ə; Ancient Greek: Ῥέᾱ) is the second-largest moon of Saturn and the ninth-largest moon in the Solar System. It is the second smallest body in the Solar System, after the asteroid and dwarf planet Ceres, for which precise measurements have confirmed a shape consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium.[7][8] It was discovered in 1672 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini.
There is a 48 km-diameter impact crater at 112°W that is prominent because of an extended system of bright rays.[18] This crater, called Inktomi, is nicknamed "The Splat", and may be one of the youngest craters on the inner moons of Saturn.[18] No evidence of any endogenic activity has been discovered.[18]
